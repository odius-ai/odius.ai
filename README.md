Odius is an experimental AI project that aims to utilize machine learning to create unique NFTs. We love the art that is possible to create with GANs, it is truly fascinating to see beautiful works that are completely generated from a computer. We hope to make a fun ecosystem that combines our passion for AI and art, made possible through the means of DeFi and NFTs.
